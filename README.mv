Taxi Manager
============

The city of Paris wanted to conduct a study on the viability of electric taxis in the French capital, including the placement of recharging stations for the taxis. We had at our disposal a file containing the GPS coordinates of all taxis in Paris at any time of the day for a period of one week (needless to say that the file was huge), as well as the information if the taxi was occupied or empty. The goal was to find the points of the city where the greatest number of empty taxis circulated in order to install charging stations at these locations.

The program was developed in Flash, and shows the movements of the taxis during the day over a map of Paris. Different views modes, filters, as well as the ability to track a taxi in particular have also been implemented.
